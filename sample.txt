//All Lynxes have tufts, although those of the Eurasian Lynx and the Canada Lynx are larger than those of the Bobcat.
//When it comes to paws, the Lynx living at higher latitudes have very large ones, acting as snowshoes.
//Lynx prefer to sleep hidden in small caves or up trees.


//Many cats mew, others do not. Generally speaking 'big cats' do not mew, smaller cats do mew. A Lynx however does indeed mew despite //being quite a sizeable cat!

//Lynxes are very solitary creatures and are seldom seen in the wild by humans.
